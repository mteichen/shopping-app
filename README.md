# Description
Final Project for SE333: Software Testing taken at DePaul in the Winter 2020-2021 quarter. Application code written by Professor Daniel Walker. Written with bad coding practices on purpose for demonstrating testing techniques. My additions to the software included:
* all testing frameworks
* changes to gradle tool to include appropriate libraries
* inclusion of code analysis tools
* elimination of various deprecated code in base software implementation
* tweak in base software implementation to line up with standard coding practices

Base code taken from Professor Daniel Walker at https://github.com/walkerdan/shopping-app



# ShoppingApp
ShoppingApp is a rudimentary online shopping application that is used to demonstrate various software testing techniques and concepts.

In its base form, the application has no tests but over the course of a quarter the student adds:
* unit tests
* several kinds of functional tests
* performance tests
* code coverage analysis
* static code analysis
